# 4. The interpretation of the graph can be done when the graph is provided in the exercise.


#The graph titled "Sentiments of Tweets Per Day" presents the distribution of tweet sentiments from July 14, 2020, to July 21, 2020, categorized into Negative, Neutral, and Positve sentiments. Each bar represents the count of tweets in these categories over the given period.

# Key Points:
#*July 14, 2020:* The majority of tweets were negative, with around 2500, while neutral and positive tweets were lower.
#*July 15, 2020:* There was a significant increase in negative tweets, exceeding 4000, while neutral and positive tweets were fairly similar, each around 2000.
#*July 18, 2020:* Negative tweets decreased to approximately 2500, and the neutral and positive tweets were almost at the same level, close to 2000.
#*July 20, 2020:* The counts of negative and neutral tweets were nearly the same, around 2500, but the positive tweets were lower at around 1500.
#*July 21, 2020:* Negative tweets remained the highest (about 3500), followed by positive (~3000) and neutral (~2500).

# Conclusion:
#The chart shows that negative sentiment tweets were generally more common than neutral and positive ones throughout the period, with the highest spike in negative tweets on July 15, 2020. Although positive and neutral tweets varied, they tended to remain lower than negative tweets.
