# 1. Using the mpg Dataset
# a. Importing mpg.csv File into R

# b. Categorical Variables
# Categorical variables in mpg are: manufacturer, model, trans, drv, fl, class.

# c. Continuous Variables
# Continuous variables in mpg are: displ, year, cyl, cty, hwy.

# a. Find Manufacturer with Most Models and Model with Most Variations

#a. Plotting the Relationship with ggplot

# b. Improving Data Presentation
# This scatterplot is likely cluttered due to many models. To make it more readable, consider summarizing the data by counting the occurrences of each model by manufacturer.
