# 1. Creating a Data Frame
# a. Write the codes
data <- data.frame(
  Respondent = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
  Sex = c("Male", "Female", "Male", "Female", "Male"),
  Fathers_Occupation = c("Farmer", "Driver", "Farmer", "Others", "Driver"),
  Number_of_Siblings = c(5, 6, 3, 4, 2),
  Types_of_Houses = c("Wood", "Concrete", "Semi-Concrete", "Wood", "Concrete")
)

# b. Structure or summary of the data
str(data)
summary(data)

# c. Is the mean number of siblings attending school 5?
mean(data$Number_of_Siblings) == 5

# d. Extract the 1st two rows and all columns
subset_1 <- data[1:2, ]
print(subset_1)

# e. Extract 3rd and 5th row with 2nd and 4th column
subset_2 <- data[c(3, 5), c(2, 4)]
print(subset_2)

# f. Select the variable 'Types of Houses' and store as types_houses
types_houses <- data$Types_of_Houses
print(types_houses)

# g. Select all Male respondents whose father's occupation is 'Farmer'
male_farmer <- subset(data, Sex == "Male" & Fathers_Occupation == "Farmer")
print(male_farmer)

# h. Select all Female respondents with >=5 number of siblings attending school
female_siblings <- subset(data, Sex == "Female" & Number_of_Siblings >= 5)

# 2. Creating an empty data frame
df <- data.frame(

# 3. Creating a CSV file and saving it as HouseholdData.csv
write.csv(data, "HouseholdData.csv")

# a. Import the CSV file into the R environment
imported_data <- read.csv("HouseholdData.csv")

# b. Convert 'Sex' into factor and change it into integer
imported_data$Sex <- as.integer(factor(imported_data$Sex, levels = c("Male", "Female")))

# c. Convert 'Types of Houses' into factor and change it into integer

# e. Select all Female respondents whose fatherâ€™s occupation is Driver
female_driver <- subset(imported_data, Sex == 2 & Fathers_Occupation == 2)

# f. Select respondents with >=5 siblings attending school
